                        My natural skills to catch on quickly, along with my caring personality will allow me to always bring change to my work environment. My approach to changing the world is largely inspired by creating a better life for the next generation, which youâ€™ll find reflected in my interactions with other and fight for social injustices. I believe that changing the world starts with changing the lives of those directly impacted by myself, and I hope that my positive influence will spread to those that I come in contact with.
