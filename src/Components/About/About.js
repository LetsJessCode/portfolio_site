                    Results-driven software engineer with a passion for helping people. Having experience with medical insurance & my natural ability to learn new skills quickly, I’ll become a  productive employee in record time. My app ‘A Date Night Site’ shares stay-at-home date ideas to keep relationships fresh & alive (especially now!). My professional characteristics are: Bright / Bubbly, Reliable, Professional, Flexible. I believe that changing the world starts with changing the lives of those I interact with directly, I hope that my positive influence leaves each person in a better place than before we met.
